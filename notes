Notes on things to calculate:

interpolate/calculate data for missing highs/lows/means

Temperature swings (sd high?)

Humidity?

Wind exposure

total frosts, last frost, killing frost (< -2), potential ground frost (air temp - 2.5 < 0)

Temperature indices from Ramos, Jones, Martinez-Casasnovas 2008 (10.3354/cr00759)
1. GSTavg Average growing season temperature (April to October)
2. GSTmax Average growing season maximum temperature (April to October)
3. GSTmin Average growing season minimum temperature (April to October)
4. NDTmin90p Annual number of days with minimum temperature > 90th percentile
5. NDTmax90p Annual number of days with maximum temperature > 90th percentile
6. NDTmin10p Annual number of days with minimum temperature < 10th percentile
7. NDTmax10p Annual number of days with maximum temperature < 10th percentile
8. FD Frost occurrence; number of days with minimum temperature < 0 C
9. FFL Frost-free period length; number of days between dates with temperature < 0 C
10. ND25 Number of days with Tmax > 25 C
11. ND30 Number of days with Tmax > 30 C
12. WI Winkler Index (Winkler et al. 1974) Sum (Tm - 10) for Tm average daily temperature (Apr-Oct)
13. HI Huglin Index (Huglin 1978) Sum K*(((Tm-10)+ (Tmax-10) )/2) for Tm = average daily , Tmax = max daily, K = length-of-day-coeff. = 1.02 to 1.06 from 40 to 50 oN (Apr-Sept)
14. BEDD Biologically Effective Degree Days
15. DTR Daily temperature range during ripening (Tmax – Tmin; August and September)

Precipitation indices
1. Pannual Total annual precipitation
2. Pgs Total growing season precipitation (April to October)
3. Pmax Maximum 1 d precipitation total
4. Rainfall during
  P-I Stage I: budbreak to bloom — April 1 to  May 10
  P-II Stage II: bloom to véraison — May 11 to  June 30
  P-III Stage III: ripening (veraison to harvest) — July 1 to September 15
  P-IV Stage IV: post harvest — September 15 to October 31
  P-V Stage V: dormant period — November 1 to April 1
5. NP95p Number of days with precipitation > 95th percentile (very wet days)
6. %P95p Percentage of annual precipitation recorded on very wet days
7. DPL Maximum annual drought period
